# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This repo successfully compiles two lists of retiring and mentorship eligible employees. Data tables were created consisting of these individuals, as well as summary dataframes grouped by employee title (manager, engineer, etc.).

## The Problem
The problem faced in this repo was the sheer amount of data on employees that was provided for analysis. With the number of rows in the multiple thousands, it is obvious why a SQL query was used to narrow the list for analysis. We were trying to learn about the employees that were nearing retirement age based on their birth date. Another problem was that the excel data provided was in 6 separate excel sheets. This meant we had to pull from different data sheets to gather and pinpoint what we were looking for. To begin with, an ERD was created, as seen below.
